Happy 404-day! To celebrate this day I collected some great examples of unique and entertaining 404-pages. Which one is your favourite? If you see any others that you think would fit this list you can send them my way and I add them to the list.

[Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/404) turned their 404-page into a characterization of some economic policies and how they would describe a missing page.

[Adult Swim](https://www.adultswim.com/404) not only features some great cartoons and animations but also a collection of small stories on their 404-page. The story being shown changes sometimes, so don't be surprised when the story is another when you revisit the page on a different day.

[Google](https://google.com/404) is a small surprise, you'd think that they would have a more corporate 404-page but its by far the simplest on this list. At least the title of the tab is a bit unique.

[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/404) has by far the cutest 404-page, featuring a new dog at every refresh of one of the employees of the company.

[The Norwegian Army](https://www.forsvaret.no/en/404) definitly didn't miss the mark with their unique 404-page. Or did they? I guess that is up for interperation

[The Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh](https://diopitt.org/404) is very on-brand (can a church be on-brand?) by displaying an image of St. Anthony, the patron saint of lost things.

[MIT](https://web.archive.org/web/20000128162812/mit.edu/404) used to have a cute haiku as an apology on their 404-page but sadly stopped displaying it around 2004. Luckily the WayBackMachine got us covered.

[IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/404) features a new quote of a movie on every refresh. Which one is your favourite?

[New Zealand](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Falld5xgsmi6y.jpg) played into the popular joke of maps not featuring the country due to its size and location by not displaying their own country on their 404-page. Sadly they removed this great joke.

[The Australian](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/404) shows a fake quote of a random Australian politician about the missing page.

[Gamespot](https://www.gamespot.com/404/) and [Kualo](https://www.kualo.co.uk/404) both let the visitor enjoy a little mini-game, first a simple dungeon-crawler and later Space Invaders.
