## Hello me

Hope you had a good 2026 (feels weird typing this on the first day of the year). You still happy with the redesign of the blog? At least current me is very happy with it, even if the website is a tiny bit larger than the old layout, but oh well. Let's talk plans for this year shall we?


## Plans for 2026

One big plan that I hope you fullfilled was photopgraphing the solar-eclipse in A Coruña. The first full solar-eclipse over Europe of our life is something you should definitly not miss, especially considering the next one over West-Europe is in 2081. I am very curious if I upgraded our camera and lens for this photoshoot. I am 95% sure the Sony A6000 and 70-350mm lens I have currently will not be enough. Also this will be the first holiday completely on your own of your life, so I will make sure it will be special.
<br><br>
The next biggest thing will probably be finally getting a car-license. If I don't get it in 2026 I will never manage to get it. I wonder what car you chose. I am still on the fence if I should specifically get a Toyota or just grab whatever is the cheapest in the area when it's finally time to purchase a car. Let's see which side the coin landed on.
<br><br>
As boring and basic as it is, let's also really focus on fitness this year. The current contract with my gym is running out in February and I think its time to not just look for the cheapest in the city anymore as the main-reason to pick one. Also don't forget to pick up running again. I know it sucks that we lost so much of our already achieved endurance over the lazy winter but that half-marathon will only get more difficult and I would love to improve on my last years result of 15km at the World Run in Breda.
<br><br>
On the topic of employment, let's continue to look up and push forward. I know that 2025 was the roughest year in that regard of our life but thats only more reason to continue on everything that we learned and achieved. You know your skill, your worth and your talents so don't sell yourself short.

## Ideas for 2026

That little sidehustle on Etsy has so much potential, but also is not running at nearly what it could be. Should we take it physically and get a booth at car-shows and such? It's certainly worth a thought, and there are more than enough shows where we could make big bank with that and gain so much experience.
<br><br>
Also why not finally realize the dream of cycling 100km in one go? We have the Netherlands right next door and it would mean a lot to us if we could prove our worth. It doesn't need to be fast, but it just needs to get done.

## Wishes for 2026

Tell people you love them. Show your friends and family how much you appreciate them, don't hide behind any false pretenses of what people could think. Make the world brighter by showing everyone that they are loved and cared for.
<br><br>
Be there for people in need. Continue to volunteer, help locally, offer a hand when you see someone who needs it.
<br><br>
Continue to thrive for improvements. 2025 was a year of self-discovery and even if parts hurt, we are far from done. I already know who I am, but not who I can be, be it in health, hobbies, personality or work.

## So far so good

I hope that when I read this in 365 days I can look back on a good 2026. The world is crazy and has many problems, but that is no reason not to work on them. _Also don't wait 9 months to post another blog!_
