*Notice: This blog is part of a series called "100%" in which I describe the steps I took to cover all cases a website can face and get the maximum out of what a feature can offer*


A big theme with this blog is getting the most with the least resources spend. One big point about this is working with images. At the time of writing the build-size of this entire website is 252kb in size, which is just 85kb more than the first unedited image you get when searching for "cat" on Google. In the following I will explain how I create my images and reduce them in size to be as small as possible. All software used is open-source and linked and works under both Windows and Linux if you want to follow along.

# Original image

When creating an image I use DALL·E 2 by OpenAi, the creators of ChatGPT. The tool works great with the small requirements I have and gives me an image I want extremly quickly. Below is the original image (hosted on imgur) without any modification done:

![The original unedited image I am going to use for this post](https://i.imgur.com/9Z7r7F9.png)

Without any modification done the image is 1,40 MB big. That is an astonishing 7,77% bigger than the entire website so far. We can definitly improve this

# Dithering and resizing

I got (as so often) inspired by LOW←TECH MAGAZINE who also use dithering to minimize their images. Dithering is a technique used in digital image processing and audio to reduce visible or audible artifacts in low-resolution representations. Dithering adds a pattern of noise to smooth transitions between different colors or shades. I am using a tool called [Didder](https://github.com/makew0rld/didder) which makes dithering and editing images really easy using any terminal. One big thing is using the right EDM (Error Diffusion Matrix) to edit the image. Each results in a slightly different style and filesize. I wrote a quick Powershell-script that uses a test-image to generate the image and also resize it to 200x200. As a palette I am using for now just "black white". I also use `-c size` which makes the image even smaller:

Algorithm | Size | Size with `-c size`
---|---|---
Atkinson | 5.96kb | 5.40kb
StevenPigeon | 6.22kb | 5.66kb
Simple2D | 6.30kb | 5.80kb
TwoRowSierra | 6.93kb | 6.25kb
FalseFloydSteinberg | 6.96kb | 6.35kb
Burkes | 7.04kb | 6.46kb
FloydSteinberg | 7.13kb | 6.55kb
SierraLite | 7.20kb | 6.58kb
Stucki | 7.27kb | 6.65kb
JarvisJudiceNinke | 7.82kb | 7.10kb
Sierra | 7.93kb | 7.22kb

Command for Atkinson: `didder -i original.png -p "black white" --width 200 --height 200 -c size -o output.png edm Atkinson`

What this command does is it uses `didder.exe`,  
takes the input image `-i original.png`,  
applies the color-palette `-p "black white"`,  
changes the dimension of the image to `--width 200 --height 200`,  
optimizies the output for size with `-c size`,  
outputs the image with the filename `-o output.png`  
after using the `edm Atkinson` to dither the image.

As you can see with just one command we made the image an absolutely amazing 265x smaller, or just 0,37661% of the original image. But we are not stopping here, let's go even further beyond.

# Coloring

So far the palette we used makes this image only black and white, but we don't want this. I want to use four colors that replace the existing ones of the original. For this we have to use the original image again since we can only take colors away, not magically add new ones in. With a bit of trial-and-error I found a nice color-palette that replaces all existing colors with a choice of four red-tones I picked:

`didder -i original.png -p "black 2b2b2b 565656 DCDCDC" -r "4f1403 8a594b c59e93 ffe3db" --width 200 --height 200 -c size -o output.png edm Atkinson`

What this command does is it uses `didder`,  
takes the input image `-i original.png`,  
applies the color-palette `-p "black 2b2b2b 565656 DCDCDC"`, 
recolors the image by mapping the palette to `-r "4f1403 8a594b c59e93 ffe3db"`,  
changes the dimension of the image to `--width 200 --height 200`,  
optimizies the output for size with `-c size`,  
outputs the image with the filename `-o output.png`  
after using the `edm Atkinson` to dither the image.

And after this we get following image:

While I cannot explain it since this image has more colors than the black-white one, it is just a bit smaller coming in at 5.29kb or 271x smaller than the original. But I hope you didn't think I am happy with this. Let's go even smaller.

# Reducing colors

*"But we just reduced the colors to four, how can we reduce them even more?"* You might be thinking. Well, we reduced the colors on the outside to four, but under the hood the image is still 24bit. We don't need this overhead, 4bit just what we need. For this step we will need another tool called [Magick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/magick.php) that is an absolute amazing little piece of software to edit images. With the command `magick input.png -colors 4 output.png` we can make this image a true 4bit image which matches what we see in the front. What this command does is:

It uses `magick`,
takes the input-image `input.png`,
and sets the color-palette of the original image to just 4 not just in the front, but also the back with `-colors 4`
and finally outputs the image under the filename `output.png`.

With all of this we shaved of even more bits and bytes. The image is now just 3.57kb small, a reduction of 99.75% or 400%. Not bad, but guess what? We are not done yet

# Removing metadata

Every file has some metadata attached to it. This can be when the image was created, where it was taken or who made it. We don't need those bytes, let's remove them. For this we will need another tool called [exiftool](https://exiftool.org/) which can manage the metadata of basically every file you throw at it. With the command `exiftool -all= input.png` all metadata gets removed from the image, leaving behind an image with absolutely nothing we don't need. You might have noticed that we are not setting an output, that's because exiftool does this for us. It removes all metadata and copies it to a file with the original filename, but keeps a copy of the original called `input.png_original` in our case. With the metadata stripped the image is now just a measly 3.41kb big, a reduction of 99.76% of the original or 420%. Nice.

# Changing filetype

At this point my story ends since I need the image to be a PNG for the Open-Graph preview-image. But you can still go smaller. For this last step we are using `magick` again to convert our image into a `gif` to make it just a bit smaller. With `magick input.png output.gif` we reached our final image with a filesize of 3.39kb. To bring it all together, let's look at the steps we took and how much they made the image smaller:

Step | Bit-size | Saved in %
---|---|---
Original | 1.469.425 | 0%
Dithering and resizing |  5.534 | 265.52%
Coloring | 5.418 | 271.21%
Reducing colors | 3.665 | 400.93%
Removing metadata | 3.496 | 420.31%
Changing filetype | 3.475 | **422.85%**

With all of those steps we reduced the image to less than a tenth of the original NES Mario which I am quite happy with. If you have any more ideas to make the images even smaller please let me know. If you want a script that does all of the steps above you can use this Powershell-script:

```ps1
# Command 1: didder
./didder -i input.png -p "black 2b2b2b 565656 DCDCDC" -r "4f1403 8a594b c59e93 ffe3db" --width 200 --height 200 -c size -o output.png edm Atkinson | Out-Null

# Command 2: magick
magick output.png -colors 4 output.png | Out-Null

# Command 3: exiftool
./exiftool -all= output.png 2>$null

# Command 4: magick
magick output.png output.gif | Out-Null
```
