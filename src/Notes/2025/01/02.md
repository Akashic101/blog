For about three years I have now primarely used Firefox as my go-to browser across all devices. It so far has been an absolute pleasure to use, especially since it's still supports the full extend of adblocking which Google is actively fighting against with their Manifest v3. But the one thing that it is still missing is proper HDR-support on Windows and Linux. Apple is so far the only one which can bask in the glory of HDR in their browsers while everyone else has to stick to SDR. This is for me especially noticable when watching the videos I record with my phone (4k / HDR / HEVC / High bitrate) in Photoprism. All the pictures look beautiful while the videos look washed out as if they where taken through a sheet of grey paper. I really hope that 2025 will finally be the year where Mozilla adds HDR-support then it will be the truly perfect browser.

For those wanting to follow for updates on the feature you can take a look at the ticket here: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=hdr
