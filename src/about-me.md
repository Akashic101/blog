  <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">Hello, I am David 👋</h1>
  <p class="text-lg">
  I am {{ 27 | age}} years old, living in Germany with my two cats and am currently working as a frontend-developer for a startup with focus on Svelte (Let's connect if you want to learn more about the project). I have worked across a wide variety of projects from developing a CRUD-system to manage employees and contracts to expanding, developing and maintaining the custom UI-library of an energy supply company in Germany. You can check out the full list of all my projects <a href="https://davidmoll.net/projects/">here</a>.</p>

 <p class="text-lg">
  Outside of work I enjoy motorsport, photography, running and cycling, media-design and working on my selfhosted homelab. If you want to see more of my daily life, why not check out my BlueSky? There I semi-actively post about things that interest me, post my newest pictures I shot and share whats interesting in my world.</p>
