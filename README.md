This is the repo of my personal blog powered by 11ty. You can access it under https://blog.davidmoll.net or via RSS at https://blog.davidmoll.net/feed.xml

## How It Works

1. Each article gets written in Markdown
2. 11ty converts all files into HTML upon launch of the project into a folder called `_site`
3. The website is accessible from my server via Cloudflare Tunnel
